# Magic-Explorer
A game made in my spare time while in training at MEDITECH.

To run the game:
  1. Download all of it!
  2. In command prompt, navigate to the directory containing Magic.exe
  3. Run the following command: Magic.exe Translate.mas "FULLPATH\Textplorer.txt"
      (FULLPATH should be replaced with the location of Textplorer.txt)
  4. Have fun!
